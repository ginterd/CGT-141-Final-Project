                <div class="col">
                    <p>As an alien, Mr. Mantis Shrimp possesses the disk-like head of a crab and a bipedal, muscular humanoid body with dull yellow skin. His eyes are shown to alternate between being crab-like to human-like on occasions. While wearing a variety of outfits throughout the series, he sticks to wearing boxing gloves. While in his human disguise,
                       he resembles a middle aged man with a permanently affixed serious expression who wears a hat in the shape of his own head. 
                    </p>
                    <p>While working for the Serpo, Mr. Mantis Shrimp wore nothing but a speedo and a tie.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mantis Shrimp is a rather complex individual. When first met, he was an aggressive yet talkative combatant,
                       regularly singing or boasting about his boosted strength, or sharing verbal exchanges with his opponents. 
                       He was also very deferential towards the Serpos who were his employers, 
                      frequently apologizing for his less than desirable performance. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Largely as a result of being a weak fighter by his species' standards, Peeny-Weeny has lived a life full of hardships.
                      His wife passed away from a congenital illness, which she also passed on to their son, Chiquitita.
                      Because Chiquitita requires regular blood transfusions due to his illness, Mr. Mantis Shrimp takes on dangerous jobs to fund them.
                      His relative weakness saw him spurned by his people and ridiculed by his employers which upsets him greatly. 
                      As such, when the Family attended to his injuries, provided him with a meal to aid in his recovery, and offered a cow for his son's 
                      blood transfusion, Mr. Mantis Shrimp was overwhelmed with emotion and vowed to aid them however he could.

                <div class="col col-lg-4">
                  <p>On his home planet, Peeny-Weeny was married and had a child. After his wife eventually died of an illness, 
                    Peeny-Weeny desperately needed to earn money for his son's blood transfusion after he attracted the same illness as his mother. 
                    Since he was a weak member of his race, Peeny-Weeny had no choice but to engage in dangerous work, which led him to become a subordinate of the Serpo. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Mantis Shrimp has tremendous amount of physical strength, being able to throw powerful punches that are capable of breaking through walls.
                     By his own admission, he's considered a weak fighter by his species' standards. He is also formidable in hand-to-hand combat.
                    </p>
                  <p>In cases of when the fight is no longer on land, Mr. Mantis Shrimp is able to change his appearance. 
                    In this form, his head resembles that of a mantis shrimp, with green, glowing eyes.
                     A second pair of wide eyes, along with antennae extending, act as the top part of his head, 
                     which flashes in response to him speaking. Around the neck is a segmented, collar-like structure. 
                     His hands change into a mantis shrimp's raptorial appendage with concentric rings of green, red, and 
                     orange that are able to open and act as shields. 
                    His feet are broad and flat, resembling flippers or the feet of an aquatic creature.
